# JQuery Salary Calculator


## Description

For this project, which I developed over the course of a weekend, I was tasked with creating a program which could calculate monthly costs for a business based off of employee annual salaries.  I broke the problem down into 3 functions.

The first function runs once the DOM is loaded.  The second function runs after the submit button on the DOM is clicked.  The last function runs if a delete button is clicked on a row.

The DOM will show a table which updates when the information of new employees is added.  On the bottom of the screen, total monthly costs are shown.  This updates as employees are added and removed.  If the total costs exceed $20,000, the background of the monthly costs text turns red.
